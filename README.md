# Data cleaning and preprocessing: Take a messy dataset and clean it up. This can include handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and transforming the data as needed. Use tools like Pandas, NumPy, or dplyr to clean and preprocess the data.
1.	Clean and preprocess a dataset of job postings to extract relevant information such as job titles, skills, and requirements.
2.	Preprocess a dataset of weather data to prepare it for use in a machine learning model.
3.	Clean and preprocess a dataset of customer transactions to identify patterns and insights that can inform marketing strategies.
4.	Clean and preprocess a dataset of daily weather reports to create a dataset that can be used for machine learning-based weather prediction.
