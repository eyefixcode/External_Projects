# Natural language processing (NLP): Use NLP techniques to analyze a corpus of text. This can include tasks like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or named entity recognition. Use Python libraries like NLTK, spaCy, or gensim to perform NLP analysis.
        1.	Use sentiment analysis to analyze tweets related to a particular topic or event.
        2.	Use topic modeling to identify themes and trends in customer reviews of a product or service.
        3.	Use named entity recognition to identify key people, places, and organizations mentioned in news articles.
        4.	Analyze customer reviews of a product to determine the sentiment and identify common topics of discussion.
        5.	Build a chatbot that can answer customer questions based on a knowledge base of frequently asked questions.
        6.	Identify the main topics of discussion in political speeches using topic modeling.
        7.	Build a sentiment analysis model using tweets on a topic of interest, e.g. the Covid-19 pandemic or the recent presidential election.
        8.	Build a topic modeling model using news articles on a specific subject, e.g. climate change or the economy.
        9.	Extract named entities from a dataset of news articles to identify key individuals and organizations mentioned.
        10.	Perform sentiment analysis on a corpus of movie reviews to determine the overall sentiment of the reviews.
